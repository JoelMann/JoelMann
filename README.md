- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoelMann
- 👀 Currently I work as a Site Reliability Engineer
- 🌱 Things I work on - currently needing to organize this. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make the world a better place - Such as TOR, OpenAPS, and tools used by people everyday.
- 📫 How to reach me - LinkedIn is best, it helps with the bot spam. 

### Languages and Stacks
In my work, I have used JS, TypeScript, Golang, Python, Ruby (Chef), and Hack (a PHP style language). 

Outside of work, I have experimented with Swift (iOS development), C (mostly in Reverse engineering challenges/CTF), and Bash. 

Stacks include mainly distributed applications in ModernJS (FE with BFF), Golang (KiteX/Hertz), Java (Spring), and SQL/Elastic search DBs with Redis caches.
