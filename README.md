- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoelMann
- 👀 I’m interested in creating innovative projects with a focus on secure, decoupled design elements that are easy to support
- 🌱 I’m currently learning project management and the basics of how AI and SDN are involved in the cloud systems we use every day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make the world a better place - Such as TOR, OpenAPS, and tools used by people everyday.
- 📫 How to reach me - LinkedIn is best. I am fairly terrible at email and facebook, but LinkedIn gets checked most often.
