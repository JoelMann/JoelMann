- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoelMann
- 👀 I’m interested in creating innovative projects with a focus on secure, decoupled design elements that are easy to support
- 🌱 I’m currently learning way too much stuff to list. In general, everyday is an information firehose.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make the world a better place - Such as TOR, OpenAPS, and tools used by people everyday.
- 📫 How to reach me - LinkedIn is best, it helps with the bot spam.
